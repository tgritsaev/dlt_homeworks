# Digital Signature Practice - Homework 1

This repository contains an implementation of the RSA and ECDSA digital signature algorithms in Python.

## Overview
The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used for secure data transmission implemented in `rsa.py`. This implementation includes key generation, encryption, and decryption.

The ECDSA implementation can be found in the `ecdsa.py` file. It includes functions for generating key pairs, signing messages, and verifying signatures.

## To run the algorithms
```bash
python3 rsa.py
python3 ecdsa.py
```
